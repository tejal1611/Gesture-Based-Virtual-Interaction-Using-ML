Traditional digital interfaces limit creativity and 
interaction by relying on physical tools. The Air 
Canvas project aims to revolutionize user 
interaction by leveraging machine learning to 
enable hands-free, dynamic digital creation and 
productivity through intuitive, gesture-based 
controls.
